## 🚀 Mission
Overby Industries is building the sustainable backbone of humanity’s future in space.  
Our focus is on **ethical, zero‑waste in‑situ resource utilization (ISRU)** to power the next century of exploration and construction.

- 🛰 Metals from asteroids (nickel, iron, PGMs).  
- 🪨 Concrete & composites from regolith & silicates.  
- 🌑 Hydrocarbons from Titan for plastics & fuel.  
- ♻️ Every process, **zero debris, zero waste**.  

We aren’t just mining rocks. We’re designing the **industrial ecosystem** to move human civilization **beyond Earth**, responsibly.

## 🧑‍🚀 Core Philosophy
- **Ethics First** – No exploitation, no orbital junk, no shortcuts.  
- **Openly Collaborative** – Code, automation logic, and systems are developed in the open.  
- **Multi‑path Contributions** – Everyone can help, whether through 💳 funds, 💻 code, or 🧠 knowledge.  
- **Fail‑Safe Engineering** – Robust control systems, redundancy, resiliency.  

This project is more than technology. It’s a **movement**.
